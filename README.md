# Interactive Dashboard - America Votes 2016

Interactive dashboard built for Al Jazeera's coverage of American Elections 2016. Instead of using traditional maps, cartogram maps were used. Simply put, cartogram is a distorted map to represent data geographically instead of area. You can read more about this concious choice by Al Jazeera here: https://medium.com/@ajlabs/why-we-departed-from-a-traditional-map-us-elections-2016-6c79e1948484

In this case, the data was electoral votes, so specialized tilegram designed by [Pitch Interactive](http://pitchinteractive.com/latest/tilegrams-more-human-maps/) was used to represent an electoral-vote-accurate map.
